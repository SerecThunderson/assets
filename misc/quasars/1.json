I gave you my heart almost 30 years ago, and I’ve finally found my way home to you. 

For years, we both set our love aside, believing it was lost to another life. 

But every star in the universe has aligned to bring us home, and all the love we once kept quiet has risen like light returning to the sky. 

Today I promise to love you without armor or walls, to speak truth even when it’s heavy, and to stay when love asks for patience - to never run from what we are meant to face together.  

You are my heart’s home - my missing piece - my balance - my forever choice. In this life, and every one after, I will always keep choosing you. 

I love you."
